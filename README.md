## *Features*

The webiste consists of three webpages:

* Home
* Stallions
* Bookings

## *Home Page*

  - The Home page has a wonderfully inviting picture of horses in a field. On this picture we have the title of the business and the navigation bar aswell as the details of our Easter Special for the selling of horse semen for breeding purposes.

- __Navigation Bar__

  - This is included on three pages. The navigation bar icons are highlighted in a different color and are underlined as you hover over them. They take you to the other two responsive pages on the website. the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page and all other pages. The navigation bar is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.

   - Almost at the bottom of the Home page there is a 'back to the top' link which when pressed takes you back to the top of the page. Very handy as it stops you from wasting time having to scroll all the way back up.

![lighthouse desktop](./images/Screenshot_lighthousedesktop.png)


  The website was tested on the following platforms to see if it worked:
  * Chrome
  * Safari

  I used developer tools alot to check accesibility and responsiveness.

  I had a couple issues along the way with learning the correct code for html and css. This was overcome by trial and error putting in the code and seeing how it affected the website.

  If i had a couple divs open in a section i needed to pay close attention to making sure all of them were closed otherwise this affected my websites layout in the sections.

 ### *Colors*

      * I used a color validator to make sure the contrast of colors on the website is balanced.

# **Testing and Debugging**

I used to following platforms to test whether my website was working:

* Chrome 
* Safari

I used developer tools alot to help me with responsiveness and accesibility issues.

I mostly learnt just by trial and error.

Googling the code for something i wasnted to do and then adjusting as and where i need worked very well.

A fault i had to learn very quick was my inability to close divs. If i had three or so divs in a section i needed to make sure they were all closed.
